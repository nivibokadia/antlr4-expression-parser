Three types of arrays: int[] || float[] || string[]
Arrays are declared(empty) as int[] array = [];
They are dynamically sized therefore you don't need to specify the size.
The operations supported: array.length;
                          array.push(value);
                          array.pop();
To access a value at particular index: array[index];
