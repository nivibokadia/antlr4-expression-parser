There are 3 types of variables: int, float and string
An int value in float variable is automatically converted to float.
A float value in int variable is floored down to an integer.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division is allowed between int,int || float,float || int,float.
Concatenation of strings is done by using a '+' sign.
